\section{Experiments} \label{sec:experiments}
In this section, we describe our experimental evaluation of four widely used algorithms on real-world datasets and our benchmark. The goal is to assess the quality of the generated $k$-means coresets. On that account, we measure the distortion. In addition, we want to measure how noise reduction affects the coreset quality. For that, we create PCA transformed version for each of the real-world datasets. As the evaluated algorithms are randomized, we repeat each experiment ten times, reporting the mean distortion and variance for different values of $k$.
