% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Coresets are among the most popular paradigms for summarizing data. In particular, there exist many high performance coresets for clustering problems such as $k$-means in both theory and practice. Curiously, there exists little work on comparing the quality of available $k$-means coresets. 

In this paper we perform such an evaluation. First, we show that it is computationally hard to compare the quality of not only two different coreset algorithms, but also of two different output of a (randomized) coreset algorithm.
In order to perform an empirical evaluation, we therefore have to work with heuristics. 
To this end, we propose and analyse a benchmark for coreset comparison. Using this benchmark and real-world data sets, we conduct an exhaustive evaluation of the most commonly used coreset implementations.
